          ({"“"}
          <span className="font-bold">Account</span>{"”"}) will be associated with

          creditor.
        </li>
        <li>
          By using your wallet in connection with the Services, you agree that
          you are using that wallet under the terms and conditions of the
          applicable provider of the wallet. Wallets are not operated by,

        </li>
        <li className="font-bold">Interaction with Protocols</li>
        <li>
          Our Software serves as the interface facilitating interaction with
          decentralized protocols and smart contract ({"“"}
          <span className="font-bold">Protocols</span>{"”"}), and we only provide
          our users the graphic user interface through our Software to
          technically interact with the Protocols{"’"} functionality such as
          {"“"}yield{"”"}, {"“"}swap{"”"}, {"“"}staking{"”"} ({"“"}
          <span className="font-bold">Services</span>{"”"}). The Service Provider
          does not own, control, or operate the Protocols, nor can it modify or
          interfere with its functionality, security, or availability. The
          Interface is not the exclusive means of accessing Protocols. All
          transactions and/or order matching, clearing, settlement, and filing
          happen in a completely decentralized fashion through the Protocols
          operated at the peer-to-peer model. We may create or launch Protocols
          or decentralized liquidity pools, provided that as soon as they are
          launched, they will not be operated or controlled by us, rather they
          will be decentralized. During the interaction with Protocols, users
          may interact with Third-party Applications (as defined in section 3
          hereof), such as HyperCore APIs in {"“"}swap{"”"} functionality or HyperCore
          APIs and smart contracts of other parties on HyperEVM in {"“"}staking{"”"}
          functionality. In such a case, the users shall bear their own risks
          when interacting with the Third-party Applications as set forth in
          section 3.
        </li>
        <li>
          You hereby acknowledge and agree that we do not execute the exchange
          of Digital Assets, either directly or through Protocols. We do not
          define, suggest, or execute any control over the price of Digital
          Assets accessible via Protocols. You do not interact with us when you
          perform swaps or interact with our Software, rather you interact with
          a Protocol directly. We do not own or control the underlying software
          that governs the operation of Protocols, even if technically supported
          by our Software or created by us.
        </li>
        <li>
          You hereby acknowledge and agree that we have no liability for any
          claims or damages that may arise as a result of any actions or
          transactions that you engage in while interacting with Protocols
          through our Software.{" "}
        </li>
        <li>
          You hereby acknowledge and agree that you bear full responsibility for
          verifying the identity, legitimacy, and authenticity of Digital Assets
          that you make transactions with any third-party using the Services and
          your choice and proceeding of Protocols. We make no representations or
          warranties that Protocols are compliant with the laws of any
          jurisdiction, and you are solely responsible for making any such
          determination with respect to your interaction with such Protocols.
        </li>
        <li>
          Your interaction with Protocols can be subject to or can incur fees,
          including fees of such Protocols or application of interest rates by
          Protocols.
        </li>
        <li className="font-bold">Interaction with Blockchains</li>
        <li>
          The Software provides its users with the graphic user interface and
          functionality to technically interact with various blockchains. The
          Software allows users to retrieve information on Digital Assets and
          their markets, technically interact with such blockchains through the
          provided graphical user interface, including, but not limited to,
          interact with blockchains for transfer of Digital Assets or submitting
          any information to blockchains.
        </li>
        <li>
          You hereby acknowledge and agree that you interact directly with the
          corresponding blockchain, we do not control your interaction with such
          blockchain and do not process or transmit any information, data, or
          transactions entered by you. You hereby acknowledge and agree that we
          have no liability for any claims or damages that may arise as a result
          of any actions or transactions that you make or engage in while
          interacting with blockchains through our Software.
        </li>
        <li>
          We reserve the right to cancel or refuse your interaction with any
          supported blockchains or the accessibility of total interaction
          functionality to you due to requirements of any applicable laws or
          regulations, and without prior notice to you.
        </li>
        <li className="font-bold">Product Updates</li>
        <li>
          The Service Provider reserves the right to make unscheduled
          deployments of changes, updates, or improvements to the Services at
          any time. We may add or remove any functionalities or features, and we
          may discontinue the Services altogether. When a new version of the
          website or application or extension is launched, we may send you
          notifications in the website or application or extension as well as a
          post on social media channels. Therefore, if you want to update the
          latest version of the application or extension, you should activate
          the update functionality in your version or install the new version
          manually.
        </li>
        <li>
          You hereby acknowledge and agree that we have no obligation to
          enhance, modify or replace any part or component of the Software or to
          continue developing or releasing new versions of the Software.

        <li>
          In consideration for access to the Software, Protocols and/or our
          Services, we, such Protocols and/or other stakeholders may take fees
          that are based on your interaction with the Software, such Protocols,
          and/or usage of our Services. Please be aware that some types of
          Protocols can apply interest rates on transactions you make with them.
        </li>
        <li>
          We will inform you of fees amounts and their description via the
          Software. Fees are subject to revision by us, Protocols, and/or other
          stakeholders with or without prior notification.
        </li>
        <li>
          You hereby agree to pay all the applicable fees and any other amounts
          incurred by you or on your behalf through the Software, in the amounts
          that are in effect when such fees are incurred.
        </li>
        <li>
          You are responsible for checking the fee schedule regularly and in
          each instance before interacting with the Software and/or Protocols or
          using Services that may incur a fee.
        </li>
        <li>
          Please be aware that blockchains, distributed ledgers or any
          decentralized networks and/or their designated third-party suppliers
          may take fees or commissions incurred by your activities or
          interaction within these blockchains, ledgers, or networks, including
          but not limited to, transaction fees. Please check their fee schedules
          prior to doing any activities with them. We are not and will never be
          responsible for commissions of any blockchains, ledgers or networks or
          any third parties even accessed through the Software.
        </li>
        <li>
          It is your responsibility to determine whether, and to what extent,
          any taxes apply to activities you perform through the Software, and to
          withhold, collect, report, and remit the correct amounts of taxes to
          the appropriate tax authorities. We do not undertake any
          responsibility to store or archive any transaction information, nor
          does the Software have any such storage or archival capability.
        </li>
        <li>
          Our fees do not comprise any taxes, levies, duties, or similar
          governmental assessments of any nature. You have the responsibility
          for paying all taxes associated with your use of our Services. If we
          have the legal obligation to pay or collect taxes for which you are
          responsible, we will invoice you and you will pay that amount unless
          you provide us with a valid tax exemption certificate authorized by
          the appropriate taxing authority. For clarity, we are solely
          responsible for taxes assessable against us based on our income,
          property, and employees ({"“"}
          <span className="font-bold">Software Taxes</span>{"”"}). If applicable law
          requires you to withhold Software Taxes from your payment(s) to
          Software, you will provide reasonable assistance to Software in
          connection with such Software Taxes by (a) promptly providing Software
          with valid tax receipts and other required documentation evidencing
          your payment of such Software Taxes; and (ii) assisting Software in
          filing applications to reduce such Software Taxes.

        <li className="font-bold">No Guarantee of Uninterrupted Access</li>
        <p className="ml-10">
          You understand and agree that we do not guarantee uninterrupted,

        <li>
          These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
          laws of the British Virgin Islands. Any dispute controversy, or claim
          arising out of, or relating to, or in connection with these Terms,
          including with respect to the formation, applicability, breach,
          termination, invalidity, enforceability or any dispute regarding
          non-contractual obligations arising out of or relating to such
          obligations, shall be referred to the BVI International Arbitration
          Centre for resolution pursuant to the BVI IAC Arbitration Rules (in
          force at the time of submission of a Notice of Arbitration and as may
          be amended from time to time). The language of arbitration shall be

          Waiver of Class Actions and Class Arbitrations. ALL CLAIMS AND
          DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE
          ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A REPRESENTATIVE
          (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, PAGA) OR COLLECTIVE CLASS BASIS. ONLY
          INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE USER,
          PERSON, OR ENTITY CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF
          ANY OTHER USER, PERSON, OR ENTITY. Accordingly, under the arbitration
          procedures outlined in this section, an arbitrator shall not combine
          or consolidate more than one party{"’"}s claims without the written
          consent of all affected parties to an arbitration proceeding. Without
          limiting the generality of the foregoing, you and the Service Provider
          agree that no dispute shall proceed by way of class arbitration
          without the written consent of all affected parties. If a decision is
          issued stating that applicable law precludes enforcement of any part
          of this subsection{"’"}s limitations as to a given claim for relief, then
          that claim must be severed from the arbitration and brought in the
          state or federal courts located in the British Virgin Islands. All
          other claims shall be arbitrated.
