          <li>
            To use our Services, you must use a third-party wallet that allows
            you to engage in transactions on blockchains. Your account on the
            Services (“<span className="font-bold">Account</span>”) will be
            associated with your blockchain address. You acknowledge and agree
            that the Service Provider is not a wallet provider, exchange,
            broker, dealer, financial institution, payments processor, money
            services business, fiduciary, or creditor.
          </li>

            you are using that wallet under the terms and conditions of the
            applicable wallet provider. Wallets are not operated by, maintained
            by, or affiliated with the Service Provider, and the Service
            Provider does not have custody or control over the contents of your
            wallet and has no ability to retrieve or transfer its contents.
          </li>
          <li>
            Service Provider accepts no responsibility for, or liability to you,
            in connection with your use of a wallet and makes no representations
            or warranties regarding how the Services will operate with any
            specific wallet. You are solely responsible for keeping your wallet
            secure and you should never share your wallet credentials or seed
            phrase with anyone. If you discover an issue related to your wallet,
            please contact your wallet provider. Likewise, you are solely
            responsible for your Account and any associated wallet and we are
            not liable for any acts or omissions by you in connection with your
            Account or as a result of your Account or wallet being compromised.
            You agree to immediately notify us if you discover or otherwise
            suspect any security issues related to the Services or your Account.

        <li className="font-bold ml-10">Interaction with Protocols</li>
        <ul className="list-disc ml-20 space-y-2">
          <li>
            Our Software serves as an interface facilitating interaction with
            decentralized protocols and smart contracts (collectively, “
            <span className="font-bold">Protocols</span>”). We only provide a
            graphical user interface through our Software to technically
            interact with Protocols’ functionalities such as “yield”, “swap”,
            and “staking” (the “<span className="font-bold">Services</span>”).
            The Service Provider does not own, control, or operate the
            Protocols, nor can it modify or interfere with their functionality,
            security, or availability. The Software is not the exclusive means
            of accessing Protocols. All transactions and/or order matching,
            clearing, settlement, and filing happen in a completely
            decentralized fashion through Protocols operating on a peer-to-peer
            model. We may create or launch Protocols or decentralized liquidity
            pools; provided that as soon as they are launched, they will not be
            operated or controlled by us, but will be decentralized. During
            interaction with Protocols, users may interact with Third-party
            Applications (as defined in Section 3), such as HyperCore APIs in
            “swap” functionality or HyperEVM smart contracts of other parties in
            “staking” functionality. In such cases, users bear their own risks
            when interacting with Third-party Applications as set forth in
            Section 3.
          </li>
          <li>
            In some cases, due to requirements of Protocols and Third-party
            Applications, your Digital Assets may be temporarily held in wallets
            of the Service Provider, secured by multi-party computation (MPC)
            provided by a third party, solely to facilitate transactions. If
            this is the case, we will notify you in advance for your consent
            before any participation. Notwithstanding the above, you can at any
            time request to withdraw your Digital Assets and the Service
            Provider will take reasonable actions to address your request within
            a reasonable time. While we implement industry-standard security
            measures, the Service Provider cannot guarantee absolute protection
            against hacking, technical failures, or other risks of loss beyond
            our control. Participation in any strategy is entirely at your own
            discretion and risk.
          </li>
          <li>
            You acknowledge and agree that we do not execute the exchange of
            Digital Assets, either directly or through Protocols. We do not
            define, suggest, or exercise any control over the price of Digital
            Assets accessible via Protocols. You do not interact with us when
            you perform swaps or interact with our Software; rather you interact
            with a Protocol directly. We do not own or control the underlying
            software that governs the operation of Protocols, even if
            technically supported by our Software or created by us.
          </li>
          <li>
            You acknowledge and agree that we have no liability for any claims
            or damages that may arise as a result of any actions or transactions
            that you engage in while interacting with Protocols through our
            Software.
          </li>
          <li>
            You acknowledge and agree that you bear full responsibility for
            verifying the identity, legitimacy, and authenticity of Digital
            Assets that you transact with any third party using the Services and
            your choice and use of Protocols. We make no representations or
            warranties that Protocols are compliant with the laws of any
            jurisdiction, and you are solely responsible for making any such
            determination with respect to your interaction with such Protocols.
          </li>
          <li>
            Your interaction with Protocols can be subject to or can incur fees,
            including Protocol fees or interest rates applied by Protocols.

            The Software provides a graphical user interface and functionality
            to technically interact with various blockchains. The Software
            allows users to retrieve information on Digital Assets and their
            markets and to interact with blockchains for the transfer of Digital
            Assets or submitting information to blockchains.

          <li>
            You acknowledge and agree that you interact directly with the

            such blockchain and do not process or transmit any information,
            data, or transactions entered by you. You acknowledge and agree that
            we have no liability for any claims or damages that may arise as a
            result of any actions or transactions that you make or engage in
            while interacting with blockchains through our Software.

          <li>
            We reserve the right to cancel or refuse your interaction with any
            supported blockchains or your access to the interaction

            regulations, and without prior notice to you.

            deployments of changes, updates, or improvements to the Services at
            any time. We may add or remove functionalities or features, and we
            may discontinue the Services altogether. When a new version of the
            website, application or extension is launched, we may send you
            notifications in the product and/or post on social media channels.
            To update to the latest version, you should enable auto-update or

            fees based on your interaction with the Software, Protocols, and/or
            usage of our Services. Some Protocols may apply interest rates on
            transactions you make with them.
          </li>
          <li>
            We will inform you of fee amounts and descriptions via the Software.

            You are responsible for checking fee schedules regularly and in each

            transaction fees. Check their fee schedules prior to any activity.
            We are not and will never be responsible for commissions of any
            blockchains, ledgers or networks or any third parties even if
            accessed through the Software.

            to withhold, collect, report, and remit the correct amounts of taxes
            to the appropriate tax authorities. We do not undertake
