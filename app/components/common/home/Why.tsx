        Traditional finance has long gate kept sophisticated trading strategies
        like delta neutral and options. These strategies offer sustainable
        returns and risk mitigation to regular users who often donâ€™t have access
        to the required financial infrastructure. Our permissionless vaults
        continuously execute strategies based on market conditions, aiming to
        maximize yields with minimal user intervention. Harmonix was born from a
        desire to democratize financial access. We believe everyone deserves
        access to powerful tools that can help them achieve their financial
        goals. By leveraging the transparency and accessibility of DeFi, we're
        making these strategies available to all, regardless of background or
        investment size.
